# Iconix Project Structure Exploration

1. Conclusion: The project is a Django-based application with multiple functional modules and data processing.

2. Evidence:
   - The root directory includes 'manage.py' and 'requirements.txt', typical for a Django project.
   - 'DjangoDemo' directory is the main Django app module, containing 'settings.py', 'urls.py', 'views', and submodules like 'utils' and 'deepSearch'.
   - 'Loras', 'doc', 'results', 'staticfiles' directories are for models, documentation, generated results, and static files.
   - 'results' directory has subdirectories for different result types: 'colored', 'filled', 'outline', 'semantic', and 'visual'.
   - 'staticfiles' includes 'admin' and 'rest_framework', indicating the use of Django Admin and DRF.

3. Risks and Assumptions:
   - Assumption that the project structure and naming follow Django conventions.
   - Unknown specific business functions and inter-module dependencies, requiring further code and document review.

4. Next Steps Recommendations:
   - Review 'settings.py' for project configuration.
   - Examine 'urls.py' and the 'views' directory for routing and view logic.
   - Study Python files in 'deepSearch' and 'utils' for data processing and business logic.
   - Check 'requirements.txt' for third-party library dependencies.
